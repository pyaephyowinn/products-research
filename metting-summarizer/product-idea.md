# AI Transcription and Document Conversion App: MVP Features and Rationale

## Objective

Define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features for an AI-powered transcription and document conversion app to enter the competitive market.

## MVP Features

1. **AI-Powered Transcription**: Convert audio/video files (MP3, WAV, MP4) to text with 95%+ accuracy using pre-trained models like Whisper or AssemblyAI’s Nano.

2. **Real-Time Transcription**: Live transcription for meetings on Zoom and Google Meet.

3. **Document Conversion (OCR)**: Extract text from PDFs, images (JPG, PNG), and scanned documents using Tesseract or Google Cloud Vision.

4. **Web-Based Editing Tools**: A browser-based editor to view, edit, and annotate transcripts with timestamps, playback, and speaker labels. Supports exports in TXT, DOCX, and SRT formats.

5. **Multilingual Support (10 Languages)**: Transcription and basic translation (to English) for 10 languages: English, Spanish, French, Mandarin, Hindi, Arabic, Portuguese, German, Japanese, Russian.

6. **Basic Integrations**: Integrate with Zoom and Google Meet for real-time transcription and Slack/Notion for sharing transcripts and summaries.

7. **_AI Summarization_**: Generate concise meeting summaries (100–200 words) with action items and key points, using NLP models like Hugging Face’s Transformers.

## Rationale Summary

- **Core Value**: Transcription and OCR address primary user needs (audio-to-text, document-to-text), filling a market gap where competitors focus on transcription alone.
- **Differentiation**: Combining real-time transcription, OCR, and multilingual support at launch sets the app apart from Otter.ai (English-focused) and Sonix (limited OCR).
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pre-trained models (Whisper, Tesseract, Hugging Face) and APIs (AssemblyAI, Google Cloud Vision) keep low development costs.
- **User Appeal**: Features target freelancers, small businesses, and educators, with integrations and summarization ensuring enterprise relevance.
- **Scalability**: 10 languages and basic integrations provide a foundation for expanding to 50+ languages and advanced features (e.g., CRM integration, sentiment analysis) post-MVP.
